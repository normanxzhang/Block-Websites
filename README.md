# Block-Websites

Used for messing around with browser extensions + reduce procrastination

- editable pop-up containing list of websites
- on page load refresh
- come up with better name

currently manifest matches url and then goes to block.js
ideally should be mutable local list of urls that block.js detects and acts upon
